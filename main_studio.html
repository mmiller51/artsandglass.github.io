  <article class="article" id="article2">Arts &amp; Glass offers two types of art for creation, Pottery Painting and Glass Fusion.

Further down are some painting and glass fusion tips if you're not sure where to get started!</article>
	
  
<article class="article" id="article3"><h1>Pottery Painting</h1><img src="Images/painting-mug-1-300x199.jpg" width="300" height="199" alt="" class="responsive" id="image2"/>For paint-your-own pottery, we have plenty of bisque pieces to choose from for painting. Visit the <a href="kiln_room.html">Kiln Room</a> page to learn more about what bisque is! All customers can pick from our large selection including cups, bowls, plates and other kitchenware, figurines and banks, as well as decorative house decor and more! When you come to the studio, and you've picked a piece to paint, our staff will walk you through the process of painting the piece and can even help bring your ideas to life. Because we at Arts &amp; Glass like to take our time with our painting, the price of each pottery piece includes your time in the studio meaning no studio fees. Take as long as you like painting, and if you don't finish in one day, we are more than happy to send your piece home with you to bring back another day to finish. There is absolutely no rush. The price of the piece also includes all of our regular paints, also known as glazes, brushes, and any other in-store matierials, as well as the firing process. We do have some specialty glazes, like our Rustic Glazes and Glitter Glazes which have a small additional fee. If you're looking for a specific piece, give us a call, but keep in mind that our stock is constantly changing with what our suppliers have in stock, so come in often so see all the new options!</article>

	<h1>Glass Fusion</h1>
	<img src="Images/WD_GlassPineappleDish_Logo-768x498.jpg" width="768" height="498" alt="" class="responsive" id="image3"/>
	
	Glass Fusion is quite different from pottery painting, although it is no leff fun or creative. Rather than a painting process, it is more of a building process, in which you take samll pieces of glass and assemble them how you would like onto a pre-cut base piece. It functions more like a mosaic process. We have pre-cute glass pieces you can use but we can also teach you how to cut glass to make your own shapes. We have plenty of examples to look at in the studio or take a look at glass fusion on pinterest to get some ideas of your own. We supply every guest with a pair of safety glasses and gloves for dealing with the glass as it is sharp. For safety reasons, we suggest children under the age of 8 work with an adult on glass projects and that they do not cut class. The price of each piece includes your time in the studio, the glass cutting materials as well as any of our regular glass colors. We have some additional glass options like glass gems and specialty colors which can be purchased.

	<h1>Tips and Tricks</h1>
	<div class="left">
	<h2>Pottery Painting Tips</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>We have many types of tools, from sponges, stencils, stamps, and silk screens; all of which are included with the price of your piece. Just ask any staff for assistance.</li>
		<br>
		<li>All of our paints are non-toxic and washable meaning they are safe for children of all ages and won't stain your clothes or the tbales!</li>
		<br>
		<li>For the best results we recommend 3 coats of pain, it dries quickly but give yourself extra time in the studio for larger or more intricate projects.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<div class="right">
	<h2>Glass Fusion Tips</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>We have patterns available, both for children and adults that you can work from int he studio OR you can bring in your own design.</li>
